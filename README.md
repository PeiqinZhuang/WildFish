# Introduction:
In this project, we collect a large scale benchmark named WildFish for fish recognition in the wild. To our best knowledge, it is the largest fish dataset compared with existing fish datasets. It consists 1000 fish categories with 54459 unconstraint images, allowing to train high-capacity models for automatic fish classification. Besides that, we also propose some novel open-set classification exploration practices and leverage pairwise textual descriptions to distinguish highly-confused species according to some realistic scenarios.
